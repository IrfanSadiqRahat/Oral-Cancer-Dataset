Oral cancer is a type of cancer that develops in the tissues of the mouth or throat. It often begins in the squamous cells lining the lips, tongue, cheeks, and the floor of the mouth. Early detection and treatment are essential, as it can spread quickly to other parts of the body. Risk factors include tobacco use, heavy alcohol consumption, and HPV infection.
